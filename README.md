Javascript bookmarklet to customise Moodle's Configurable Reports tables

Add this code as a bookmarklet in your browser.
When you have created a configurable report in Moodle click on the bookmarklet. This should highlight each cell containing raw view numbers with a heatmap colour.
The bookmarklet will also add the total count for each student to the first column and provide a bar graph of engagement levels at the top of the page.

Troubleshooting:

1. JavaScript ordering must be enabled for the report

2. The first column of the report should contain a unique identifier (name, id, etc.)

3. Only columns with a raw count of the number of views will be heatmapped.
